# Property Animations Demo

Demonstration of choreographed property animations. Jump [to the activity](https://github.com/codepath/property-animations-demo/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/codepath/skylinepropertyanimationdemo/SkylinePropertyAnimationActivity.java) for the most relevant example code. Animations illustrated include:

 * Using the `ObjectAnimator` for basic view animations
 * Using the `setRepeatMode` and `setRepeatCount` to repeat animations
 * Animating a view between two background colors using `ArgbEvaluator`
 * Configuring the interpolation mode of an animation with `setInterpolator`
 * Setting animation callback with `AnimatorListenerAdapter`
 * Choreographing multiple animations with the `AnimatorSet`
 * Using the `ViewPropertyAnimator` to easily animate a view
 * Inflating and playing animations from XML `res/animator`
 * Creating custom-timed animations with the `ValueAnimator`
